## Overview

- This project was produced as a showcase of my front-end development skills including use of React and React Hooks, Styling, Axios, Error Handling and more.

You can add likes, write and delete comments on each article. Note: only your comments can be deleted but I have added a way of switching usernames to showcase the conditional funtionality.
