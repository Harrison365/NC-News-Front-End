## Overview

- This project was produced as a showcase of my front-end development skills including the use of React and React Hooks, Styling, Axios, Error Handling and more.

- Simply navigate around the front end using the navigation buttons at the top of the page. Sort and order article lists, then click anywhere on the article cards to see more. You can write and delete comments on, and add likes for each article. Note: Only your comments can be deleted but I have added a way of switching usernames to showcase the conditional functionality.
